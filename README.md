## About Me

I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer driven by a love for problem-solving. Over the last year, I have focused heavily on transitioning from learning to building real world products. My development philosophy centers on creating software that is not only functional but also secure and intuitive.

I am particularly interested in **backend logic**, **security implementation**, and **localized solutions**.
